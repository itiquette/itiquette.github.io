[Itiquette](https://github.com/itiquette) is the place where I[(janderssonse)](https://github.com/janderssonse) put projects intended to live longer than the initial PoC-phase.
I also collect various other interesting things here, such as information about translations or development tools. So who knows, maybe you'll find something interesting here.

A short bio:

As a typical Generation X developer from Sweden, I've been in the open source world since we traded [Fred Fish floppies](https://datagubbe.se/fish/) with licenses like "send me a postcard". Over the years, I've learned and forgotten quite a few programming languages and frameworks. It's been a journey, from the days of [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) (where I spent my parents' phone bills) to today's AI-driven shift.
These days I divide my time between development, security, and helping organizations improve their open source processes. Despite that, I still write quite a lot of code.

Linux is my `$HOME`. [CLI tools](https://gabevenberg.com/posts/cli-renaissance/) are often, but not always, my choice. I thrive in DevOps environments.

## I have a soft spot for:

- [Development tools](/tools) that let you get things done
- Solving open source puzzles in organizations
- [Translations](/translations)
- Retro computing
- Security

I like bridging technical and organizational needs, without drowning in formal jargon.

Active projects can be found here, while my other [GitHub](https://github.com/janderssonse) is a mix of contributions, experiments, and archived work from over the years.
