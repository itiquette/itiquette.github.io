[Itiquette](https://github.com/itiquette) is where I[(janderssonse)](https://github.com/janderssonse) put projects intended to stay longer than the initial PoC-phase. As it turns out, it's also a place where I stash other interesting things, like info about Translations or DevTooling. So, who knows, maybe you'll find something of interest here.

A short bio might be in place.

As a typical Generation X developer from Sweden, I've been in the open source game since we traded [Fred Fish floppies](https://datagubbe.se/fish/) with "send me a postcard" licenses, and I've learned and forgotten many languages and frameworks. It has been a long ride, from the days of [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) (spending my mom's phone bills) to the current AI-driven shift.

These days I split my time between coding and helping organizations level up their open source processes. Open Source Lead, and so on, I have been called. I still write a lot of code â€“ can't keep me away from the terminal for long. 

Linux is my `$HOME`. [CLI tools](https://gabevenberg.com/posts/cli-renaissance/) is often, but not always my choice. I thrive in DevOps environments. I have translated a lot of FOSS over the years.

## I've got a soft spot for:

- [Developer tooling](/tools) that doesn't get in the way
- Solving open source puzzles in organizations
- [Translations](/translations)
- Retro computing
- Security

I like bridging technical and organizational needs without drowning in corporate speak. I'd rather explain complex tech clearly than hide behind jargon.

- My active projects live here, whereas my other [GitHub](https://github.com/janderssonse) is a mix of contributions, experiments, and archived work from over the years

Always up for hacking sessions, tech debates over coffee, or collaborating on interesting problems.
