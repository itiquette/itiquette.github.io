Translating free software is nothing new, but even in this AI-driven age, it remains relevant for several reasons. Why is that, and what are some common challenges?

## Why

Translation enables non-English speakers to access tools in their native language. This ensures that technology remains accessible regardless of linguistic background or English proficiency.

For those who care about language diversity or are generally interested in languages, translation is a matter of preserving linguistic identity. One of the bonds of society is having a common language. Even as it evolves over time, language forms a cohesive glue and is part of our cultural identity.

By translating free software, contributors democratize access to digital tools and support the fundamental FOSS principle - that software should be available to everyone.

Additionally, it exposes the translator to the full functionality of the software. The process helps in gaining a deeper understanding of both the software and its underlying concepts.

Another benefit is that translation improves the translator's personal language skills.

Also, AI-translations as a tool is really helpful, however, adding some human interaction and review will raise the quailty of those.

So, for those seeking to contribute to free software, translation offers a good entry point, requiring minimal programming knowledge.

## Challenges

While professional translation expertise isn't required, basic language proficiency is crucial for a good translation. Correct spelling and proper verb conjugations are non-negotiable. Poor translations can destroy software usability and user trust in the project, and even introduce bugs into the translated application.

Maintaining consistent terminology across different contexts is also essential for high-quality translations. There are several valid translations for terms, for example _(like "file" which can be "arkiv," "fil," or "arkivera" in Swedish)_.

Translation work can become a time sink, sometimes serving as productive procrastination, as it is easy to see results and progress. Limiting translation time helps maintain balance while still contributing.

Software continuously evolves, creating an ongoing need for updated translations. Managing this workflow can be challenging for volunteer translators.

Translating technical concepts often poses difficulties, particularly for newer technologies where established terminology might not exist. This requires creativity and linguistic sensitivity.

That is all, happy translating!
