Translating free and open source software is nothing new, but even in this AI-driven age, it remains highly relevant. So, what benefits does it have, and what are some common challenges?

## Why

Translation enables non-English speakers to access powerful tools in their native language. This ensures that technology remains accessible regardless of linguistic background or English proficiency.

For those caring about language diversity or interested in languages, translation is a matter of preserving linguistic identity. One of the bonds of a society is having a common language. Even as it evolves over time, language forms a glue and defines a part of our cultural identity.

By translating free software, contributors democratizes access to digital tools and supports the fundamental FOSS principle that software should be available to everyone.n

Also, it exposes contributors to the full scope of software functionality. The process helps in obtain a deeper understanding of both the software and its underlying concepts. Another benefit is that it improves the translators personal language skills.

So, for those seeking to contribute to free software, translation offers a valuable entry point that requires minimal programming knowledge while providing impact.

## Challenges

While professional translation expertise isn't required, basic language proficiency remains crucial. Correct spelling and proper verb conjugations are non-negotiable. Poor translations can undermine software usability and user trust in the project, and even introduce bugs into the translated application.

Maintaining consistent terminology proves essential for quality translations. Even when multiple valid translations exist for terms _(like "file" which can be "arkiv," "fil," or "arkivera" in Swedish)_, selecting and consistently using one form improves both the translation process and user experience.

Translation work can become an absorbing activity, sometimes serving as productive procrastination, as it is easy to see results and progress. Setting boundaries to timebox the translation time helps maintain balance while still contributing.

Software continuously evolves, creating an ongoing need for updated translations. Managing this workflow can be challenging for volunteer translators.

Translating technical concepts often poses difficulties, particularly for newer technologies where established terminology might not exist in the target language. This requires creativity and linguistic sensitivity.

That is all, happy localisation!
