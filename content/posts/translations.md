Even in our AI-driven world with easily accessible automatic translations, there is still a need for human translation and proofreading.
Why is that, and what are the most common challenges?

## Why translate free software?

Good translations make it possible for more people to use tools in their own language, which makes technology accessible.

For those who care about linguistic diversity or have a strong interest in languages, translation can be about preserving linguistic identity.
One of the **strongest bonds** in a society is having a common language, which functions as a unifying force.
Language is part of our cultural identity.

By translating software, one makes digital tools accessible to more people and supports fundamental principles about accessibility for everyone.

Additionally, the translator gains a deeper understanding of all the software's functions.
The process helps to understand both the software and the basic principles better.

Translation work improves the translator's language skills.

AI translations are excellent tools, but without human review they often miss context and linguistic nuances.

For those who want to start contributing to free software, translation can be a good way to get started without being able to program.

## Challenges

Even though one doesn't need to be a professional translator, basic language skills are required for a good translation.
Correct spelling and proper grammar are absolutely necessary.
Poor translations can destroy the software's usability and credibility, and in the worst case, cause errors in the translated version.

Maintaining consistent terminology across different contexts is also important for good quality.

There are often several possible translations of a word depending on the context of the same term - for example, English "file" can become "fil," "arkiv," or "dokument" in Swedish.

Translation can become a real **time thief**, sometimes as a form of productive procrastination, since it's easy to see results and progress.
Setting limits for translation time helps maintain balance.

Software is constantly being developed, which means translations must be updated continuously.
Managing a constant workflow can be a challenge for volunteers.

Translating technical concepts is often difficult, especially for new technology where established terminology doesn't exist yet.

It requires creativity, linguistic sensitivity, and knowledge of existing language choices.
