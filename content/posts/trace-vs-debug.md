# Trace vs Debug Logging: Understanding the Difference

*Recommended reading [When Should You Enable Trace-Level Logging?](https://last9.io/blog/trace-level-logging/)*

If you've ever been confused about when to use trace logs versus debug logs, you're not alone.
Many developers use these logging levels interchangeably, but they serve fundamentally different purposes. Understanding this distinction can dramatically improve your debugging effectiveness.

## The Core Difference

It is quite easy:

- **Debug logs focus on state** - they capture what your application looks like at specific points in time
- **Trace logs focus on flow** - they capture how your application got to those points

Think of debug logs as snapshots and trace logs as the events between those snapshots.

When you use both levels, you get:

1. **Complete visibility**: Trace logs show you the journey, debug logs show you the destinations
2. **Efficient troubleshooting**: You can quickly identify where in the flow something went wrong and what the state was at that point
3. **Performance insights**: Trace logs reveal timing issues, debug logs reveal data-related problems

## What Should Go in Each Log Level

### Debug Logging Should Capture

- Application state at significant points
- Variable values after important operations
- Configuration settings being used
- Conditional branch decisions and why they were made
- Data transformations and their results
- Cache state information
- Business logic outcomes

### Trace Logging Should Capture

- Method entry and exit points with timestamps
- Parameter values passed between functions
- Return values from method calls
- Execution timing data
- Thread and context information
- Step-by-step execution flow
- API call details with request/response data

## A Simple Example

.Java

```java
public Order processOrder(OrderRequest request) {
    logger.trace("Entering processOrder orderId={}", request.getOrderId());
    
    // Validate
    ValidationResult result = validate(request);
    logger.debug("Validation status={}", result.getStatus());
    
    if (!result.isValid()) {
        throw new InvalidOrderException("Invalid order");
    }
    
    // Process payment
    Payment payment = paymentService.charge(request.getTotal());
    logger.debug("Payment status={} txnId={}", payment.getStatus(), payment.getTxnId());
    
    // Save order
    Order order = new Order(request, payment);
    orderRepo.save(order);
    logger.debug("Order saved id={} total=${}", order.getId(), order.getTotal());
    
    logger.trace("Exiting processOrder orderId={}", order.getId());
    return order;
}
```

.Go

```go
func ProcessOrder(ctx context.Context, request OrderRequest) (Order, error) {
    log.Trace().Str("orderId", request.OrderID).Msg("Entering ProcessOrder")
    
    // Validate
    result := validate(request)
    log.Debug().Str("status", result.Status).Msg("Validation completed")
    
    if !result.IsValid {
        return Order{}, fmt.Errorf("invalid order")
    }
    
    // Process payment
    payment, err := chargePayment(ctx, request.Total)
    if err != nil {
        return Order{}, err
    }
    log.Debug().Str("status", payment.Status).Msg("Payment processed")
    
    // Save order
    order := NewOrder(request, payment)
    saveOrder(ctx, order)
    log.Debug().Str("id", order.ID).Msg("Order saved")
    
    log.Trace().Str("orderId", order.ID).Msg("Exiting ProcessOrder")
    return order, nil
}
```

## When to Use Each Level

### Use Debug Logging When

- **You need to understand the current state of your application**
- You're investigating data corruption issues
- You want to see the results of calculations or transformations
- You need to understand why certain decisions were made
- You're debugging complex business logic

### Use Trace Logging When

- **You need to follow the execution path through your code**
- You're investigating performance issues and timing problems
- You're debugging intermittent issues that are hard to reproduce
- You need to understand the sequence of operations
- You're troubleshooting integration issues with external services

## Best Practices

### For Debug Logs

- Focus on meaningful state changes
- Include enough context to understand the data
- Mask sensitive information
- Don't log every variable - focus on the important ones

### For Trace Logs

- Log method entry and exit points
- Include timing information when relevant
- Keep parameter logging concise but informative
- Use correlation IDs to track requests across services

### For Both

- Use structured logging with consistent field names
- Implement conditional activation (don't leave them on in production by default)
- Set up proper log rotation and retention policies
- Monitor the performance impact of verbose logging

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using only one of them**: Don't stick to just debug or just trace, you are missing half the picture
2. **Logging everything**: More logs don't always mean better debugging - be selective
3. **Ignoring performance**: Verbose logging can impact application performance
4. **Exposing sensitive data**: Always mask passwords, tokens, and personal information
5. **Poor log structure**: Unstructured logs are hard to search and analyze

## Conclusion

Understanding the difference between trace and debug logging is important. Debug logs help you understand "what", trace logs help you understand "how"". Together, they provide visibility into your application's behavior.

If in doubt when adding logging, ask yourself: "Do I need to capture state (debug) or flow (trace)?"
